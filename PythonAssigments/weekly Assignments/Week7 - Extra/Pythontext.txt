Python is a great tool for processing data. It is Likely that any program you write will involve reading, writing, or manipulating data. For this reason, itâ€™s especially useful to know how to handle different file formats, which store different types of data.

For example, consider a Python program that checks a LIKELYlist of users for access control. Your list of users will likely be stored and saved in a text file. Perhaps you are not working with text, but instead have a program that does likelyfinancial analysis. In order to do some number crunching, you will LIKELY have to input those numbers from a saved spreadsheet. Regardless of your application, it is almost guaranteed that inputting or outputting data will be involved.Python is a great tool for processing data.
