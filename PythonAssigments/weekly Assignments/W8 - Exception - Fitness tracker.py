'''Fitness Checker Grade 15
The simple measure of body fitness is the BMI or Body Mass index. It depends only on the height L and weight W of a person.
 It is defined as BMI = [weight / height^2] where weight is taken in kilograms and height in meters.
Four general grades are proposed:
Underweight[U] â€“ when BMI < 18.5
Normal weight[N] - 18.5 <= BMI < 25.0
Heavyweight [H] - 25.0 <= BMI < 30.0
Overweight [O] - 30.0 <= BMI
Write a program that takes in the Weight (in Kg) and Length (in meters) of an individual and displays the grade as U, N, H, O
Input :
The test case contains 2 space separated numbers W, L denoting the Weight and the Length. [W is an integer . H is a number with 2 decimal spaces]
Output
For the Test Case specify the BMI Grade as U,N,H or O
Example
Input
200 1.73
Ouput
O
Constraints :Consider all possible scenarios of exceptions that may occur while reading the weight and height
