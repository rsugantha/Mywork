Python is a great tool for processing data.
 It is likely that any program you write will involve reading, writing, or manipulating data.
 For this reason, itâ€™s especially useful to know how to handle different file formats, which store different types of data.


For example, consider a Python program that checks a list of users for access control.
 Your list of users will likely be stored and saved in a text file.
 Perhaps you are not working with text, but instead have a program that does financial analysis.
 In order to do some number crunching, you will likely have to input those numbers from a saved spreadsheet.
 Regardless of your application, it is almost guaranteed that inputting or outputting data will be involved.
